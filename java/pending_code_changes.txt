Code changes:
 - Switching the internal implementation of isPossible and related functions
   to use the new possibleLengths metadata. This affects a lot of countries,
   making isPossible more restrictive as more precise data is available. It
   also affects parsing ambiguous and invalid numbers, as we decide whether
   to strip a possible national prefix (1) or country code based on the length
   of the number and whether it is possible before or after this.
